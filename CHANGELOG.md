  - High contrast styling: Enhanced visibility with professional appearance
  - Canvas integration: Tree selection properly updates canvas view

### Changed - Startup & Integration

- **Startup sequence**: Simplified to pure JavaFX initialization
- **Thread coordination**: Platform.runLater() usage consolidated
- **Selection handling**: Clean JavaFX selection logic
- **Production code**: Removed transitional debug output

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Key JavaFX Files** (current set):
  - `FDDCanvasFX.java` - Modern JavaFX canvas (zoom/pan)
  - `FDDGraphicFX.java` - Element rendering with smart contrast
  - `CenteredTextDrawerFX.java` - Optimized text rendering utilities
  - `FDDTreeViewFX.java` - JavaFX tree implementation
  - `FDDActionPanelFX.java` - Action button panel

- **Removed Legacy**:
  - All Swing frame/canvas bridge classes (FDDFrame, FDDCanvasBridge, CanvasSelector, FDDGraphic) deleted
  - Swing TreeNode coupling removed from model
  - Swing dependencies pruned from pom.xml

- **Canvas Architecture**: BorderPane layout with ScrollPane, VBox control panel, and GraphicsContext rendering
- **Thread Safety**: Proper coordination between JavaFX and Swing EDT threads
- **Memory Management**: Efficient canvas sizing and redraw optimization
-- **Bridge Pattern**: Retired; application now fully JavaFX

### Fixed - Previous Issues

- **JavaFX Milestone Completion**: Fixed milestone status synchronization in FDDElementDialogFX
  - Milestone completion checkboxes now properly update the model
  - Progress bars correctly reflect milestone completion status
  - No more "Index out of bounds" errors when toggling milestones
  - Full save/load functionality for milestone states

### Changed - Robustness Improvements

- **Enhanced error handling**: Added proper bounds checking in milestone progress calculation
- **Improved debugging**: Added console output for milestone updates (removed in production)
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Verified on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Performance optimization**: Eliminated complex scene traversal overhead
