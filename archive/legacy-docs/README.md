# Legacy Documentation Archive

The markdown files in this directory were migrated from the project root to reduce clutter. They represent historical migration notes, completed phase summaries, or deprecated guidance.

Moved here on 2025-08-10:

- DESKTOP_API_MIGRATION.md
- JAVAFX_CANVAS_COMPLETE.md
- JAVAFX_TREE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- JAVAFX_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md (latest consolidated guide retained under /archive for reference)
- PHASE_7_JAVAFX_FOUNDATION_COMPLETE.md
- SWING_TO_JAVAFX_FUNCTIONALITY_MAPPING.md (superseded by current README + ROADMAP parity snapshot)
- MACOS_INTEGRATION.md (superseded by MacOSIntegrationService inline docs)
- MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md
- PHASE_7_JAVAFX_FOUNDATION_COMPLETE.md
- SWING_REMOVAL_VERIFICATION.md (kept for historical verification; AWT removal now documented in CHANGELOG)

If you need to resurrect guidance from these, copy relevant sections into current active docs instead of editing in place to preserve historical traceability.
