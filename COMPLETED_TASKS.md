### ✅ Text Rendering & Visual Quality Improvements

**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Font Rendering Excellence

- **Optimal Font Selection**: Priority system favoring SF Pro Text Semi-Bold for crisp rendering
- **Cross-Platform Fonts**: Fallback to Segoe UI (Windows), Roboto, Source Sans Pro, Liberation Sans
- **Semi-Bold Weight**: Enhanced text visibility and readability at all zoom levels
- **Decorative Font Filtering**: Excludes non-readable fonts like Impact, Comic Sans, Papyrus

#### Smart Text Contrast System

- **Intelligent Contrast Detection**: Analyzes text position over progress bars for optimal visibility
- **Dynamic Color Adjustment**: Black text over light areas, white text over dark progress sections
- **Progress Bar Integration**: Single percentage display with perfect text positioning
- **High Contrast Styling**: Professional appearance with excellent readability

### ✅ Edit Dialog UX Enhancement

**Date**: August 2025 Session  
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Problem Solved: Node Selection Loss After Edit

- **Issue**: "When I close the dialog the node focus is lost. When the dialog is closed, focus should be returned to the node I was just editing"
- **Root Cause**: Edit operations didn't restore tree selection after dialog completion
- **Impact**: Users lost their place in the tree after editing, disrupting workflow

#### Technical Solution Implemented

- **Enhanced editSelectedFDDElementNode()**: Captures currently selected node before opening edit dialog
- **Focus Restoration Callback**: Modified DialogBridge callback to restore selection after dialog closes
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with both JavaFX and Swing tree implementations
- **Smart Selection**: Uses `projectTreeFX.selectNode()` for JavaFX, TreePath search for Swing trees
- **Thread-Safe Execution**: Platform.runLater() for JavaFX, SwingUtilities.invokeLater() for Swing

#### Code Implementation

```java
private void editSelectedFDDElementNode() {
    FDDINode currentNode = getCurrentSelectedNode();
    final FDDINode nodeBeingEdited = currentNode;
    
    DialogBridge.showElementDialog(this, currentNode, accepted -> {
        if (accepted) {
            refreshTreeAfterChange();
            // ... update operations
        }
        // Restore focus to the edited node after dialog closes
        restoreNodeSelection(nodeBeingEdited);
    });
}

private void restoreNodeSelection(FDDINode nodeToSelect) {
    if (useJavaFXTree && projectTreeFX != null) {
        Platform.runLater(() -> projectTreeFX.selectNode(nodeToSelect));
    } else if (projectTree != null) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
            TreePath pathToNode = findTreePath(projectTree, nodeToSelect);
            if (pathToNode != null) {
                projectTree.setSelectionPath(pathToNode);
                projectTree.scrollPathToVisible(pathToNode);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### Files Modified

- `FDDFrame.java`: Enhanced edit method with focus restoration
- Added `restoreNodeSelection()` and `findTreePath()` helper methods
- Imported `SwingUtilities` and `DefaultMutableTreeNode` for Swing tree support

### ✅ JavaFX Tree View Default Implementation

**Date**: August 2025 Session
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Major Accomplishment: JavaFX Tree as Default

- **JavaFX Tree View**: Now the default tree implementation on startup
- **Auto-expand functionality**: All tree nodes expand by default
- **Root node selection**: Automatically selects root node on initialization
- **Canvas integration**: Tree selection properly updates canvas view
- **Reliable startup sequence**: Swing tree starts first, then automatically switches to JavaFX
- **Production ready**: All debug output removed for clean professional code

#### Technical Implementation

- **FDDTreeViewFX**: Complete JavaFX tree component with high contrast styling
- **FDDActionPanelFX**: Professional action button panel with text symbols
- **Thread coordination**: Proper JavaFX/Swing integration using Platform.runLater()
- **Selection handling**: Enhanced onSelectionChanged() supporting both tree types
- **TreePath creation**: Custom implementation for JavaFX tree selections

#### Files Created/Modified

- `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/fx/FDDTreeViewFX.java` - Complete JavaFX tree
- `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/fx/FDDActionPanelFX.java` - Action button panel
- `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/FDDFrame.java` - Enhanced with automatic JavaFX switching

#### Canvas Testing Results

- ✅ Application starts with JavaFX tree by default
- ✅ All tree nodes expand automatically on startup
- ✅ Root node automatically selected
- ✅ Canvas view updates correctly with tree selection changes
- ✅ Manual tree switching (View menu) still functional
- ✅ Context menus and tree operations working
