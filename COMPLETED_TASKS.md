# Completed Tasks Summary

## JavaFX Migration - Phase 3 Tree View Complete

### ✅ JavaFX Tree View Default Implementation

**Date**: August 2025 Session
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Major Accomplishment: JavaFX Tree as Default

- **JavaFX Tree View**: Now the default tree implementation on startup
- **Auto-expand functionality**: All tree nodes expand by default
- **Root node selection**: Automatically selects root node on initialization
- **Canvas integration**: Tree selection properly updates canvas view
- **Reliable startup sequence**: Swing tree starts first, then automatically switches to JavaFX
- **Production ready**: All debug output removed for clean professional code

#### Technical Implementation

- **FDDTreeViewFX**: Complete JavaFX tree component with high contrast styling
- **FDDActionPanelFX**: Professional action button panel with text symbols
- **Thread coordination**: Proper JavaFX/Swing integration using Platform.runLater()
- **Selection handling**: Enhanced onSelectionChanged() supporting both tree types
- **TreePath creation**: Custom implementation for JavaFX tree selections

#### Files Created/Modified

- `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/fx/FDDTreeViewFX.java` - Complete JavaFX tree
- `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/fx/FDDActionPanelFX.java` - Action button panel
- `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/FDDFrame.java` - Enhanced with automatic JavaFX switching

#### Testing Results

- ✅ Application starts with JavaFX tree by default
- ✅ All tree nodes expand automatically on startup
- ✅ Root node automatically selected
- ✅ Canvas view updates correctly with tree selection changes
- ✅ Manual tree switching (View menu) still functional
- ✅ Context menus and tree operations working
- ✅ Cross-platform thread coordination stable

### ✅ FDDElementDialogFX Milestone Fix

**Date**: Previous session
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Issues Fixed

- **Milestone completion not working**: Milestone checkboxes didn't update the model
- **Progress calculation broken**: Features didn't show "In Progress" status
- **Index out of bounds errors**: Complex scene graph traversal was failing
- **Syntax errors**: Missing closing braces causing compilation failures

#### Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: Complex nested scene graph lookups were unreliable
- **Solution**: Added direct `milestoneGrid` reference storage
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/fx/FDDElementDialogFX.java`
  - Fixed milestone synchronization logic
  - Added proper bounds checking
  - Enhanced error handling and debugging

#### Testing Results

- ✅ Milestone toggling works without errors
- ✅ Progress bars update immediately
- ✅ Save/load preserves milestone states
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility verified

#### Impact

- **User Experience**: Seamless milestone management in JavaFX
- **Data Integrity**: Reliable save/load of milestone states
- **Performance**: Eliminated complex scene traversal overhead

## Previous Completed Tasks
