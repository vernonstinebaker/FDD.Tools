# Completed Tasks Summary

## JavaFX Migration - Phase 2 Complete

### ✅ FDDElementDialogFX Milestone Fix

**Date**: Current session
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Issues Fixed

- **Milestone completion not working**: Milestone checkboxes didn't update the model
- **Progress calculation broken**: Features didn't show "In Progress" status
- **Index out of bounds errors**: Complex scene graph traversal was failing
- **Syntax errors**: Missing closing braces causing compilation failures

#### Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: Complex nested scene graph lookups were unreliable
- **Solution**: Added direct `milestoneGrid` reference storage
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/main/java/net/sourceforge/fddtools/ui/fx/FDDElementDialogFX.java`
  - Fixed milestone synchronization logic
  - Added proper bounds checking
  - Enhanced error handling and debugging

#### Testing Results

- ✅ Milestone toggling works without errors
- ✅ Progress bars update immediately
- ✅ Save/load preserves milestone states
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility verified

#### Impact

- **User Experience**: Seamless milestone management in JavaFX
- **Data Integrity**: Reliable save/load of milestone states
- **Performance**: Eliminated complex scene traversal overhead
