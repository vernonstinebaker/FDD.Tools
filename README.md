# FDD Tools

A modern Feature-Driven Development (FDD) project management tool built with Java and JavaFX.

## Overview

FDD Tools is a desktop application that helps teams manage Feature-Driven Development projects. It provides advanced visualization and management capabilities for FDD hierarchies including Programs, Projects, Aspects, Subjects, Activities, and Features. The application features a modern JavaFX interface with professional zoom/pan canvas capabilities and seamless user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Java 21** (Latest LTS version)
- **JavaFX 21** - Modern UI framework with canvas capabilities
- **Swing Integration** - Bridge pattern for legacy compatibility  
- **Maven** for build management
- **JAXB/Jakarta XML Bind** for XML processing
- **OpenCSV** for CSV file handling

## Key Features

### âœ… Modern JavaFX Interface

- **Professional Canvas**: Zoom (0.1x-5.0x) and pan capabilities with mouse/keyboard controls
- **High-Quality Rendering**: SF Pro Text font with smart contrast detection  
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom panel, context menus, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Image Export**: Save canvas as PNG/JPEG with file chooser dialog

### âœ… Advanced Tree Management

- **Work Package Management**: Feature assignment and organization
- **XML Project Files**: Reliable save/load with validation
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support

## Building and Running

FDD Tools uses a clean, best-practices approach for deployment:

### Building the Application

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This creates a self-contained "fat JAR" at `target/FDDTools-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` that includes:

- All JavaFX dependencies
- All required libraries
- Proper macOS Desktop API integration
- Application icon and resources

### Running the Application

#### Direct execution

```bash
java -jar target/FDDTools-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### macOS Integration

The application properly integrates with macOS using the Desktop API:

- Shows "FDD Tools" in the menu bar (not "java")
- **System Menu Bar**: Application menus appear in the macOS system menu bar at the top of the screen (not in the window)
- **Custom Dock Icon**: Displays the FDD Tools icon in the dock (not the generic Java icon)
- Handles macOS About, Preferences, and Quit menu items
- Follows macOS UI guidelines

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses `MenuBar.setUseSystemMenuBar(true)` for proper menu integration
- Multiple icon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128) for optimal dock display
- AWT Taskbar API for reliable dock icon setting
- Early property configuration for consistent macOS behavior

### Development

For development, you can run directly through Maven:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

### Architecture

- **Fat JAR**: Single executable JAR containing all dependencies
- **Desktop API**: Native macOS integration without external scripts
- **JavaFX 21**: Modern UI framework with high-DPI support
- **Maven**: Standard build system following best practices

No shell scripts, no complex bundling - just a clean, professional executable JAR.
