# FDD Tools

A modern Feature-Driven Development (FDD) project management tool built with Java and JavaFX.

## Overview

FDD Tools is a desktop application that helps teams manage Feature-Driven Development projects. It provides advanced visualization and management capabilities for FDD hierarchies including Programs, Projects, Aspects, Subjects, Activities, and Features. The application features a modern JavaFX interface with professional zoom/pan canvas capabilities and seamless user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Java 21** (Latest LTS version)
- **JavaFX 21** - Modern UI framework with canvas capabilities
- **Maven** for build management
- **JAXB/Jakarta XML Bind** for XML processing
- **OpenCSV** for CSV file handling
- **SLF4J + Logback (in progress migration)** â€“ replacing java.util.logging for structured logging

## Key Features

### âœ… Modern JavaFX Interface

- **Professional Canvas**: Zoom (0.1xâ€“5.0x) and pan capabilities with mouse/keyboard controls
- **High-Quality Rendering**: SF Pro Text font with smart contrast detection  
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom panel, context menus, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Image Export**: Save canvas as PNG/JPEG with file chooser dialog

### âœ… Advanced Tree & Persistence Management

- **JavaFX Tree View**: Default interface with auto-expand & orange accent theming
- **Smart Selection**: Automatic root node selection and focus restoration
- **Context Menus**: Right-click operations for all node types (styled)
- **Recent Files (MRU)**: Persistent list of recently opened projects
- **Layout Persistence**: SplitPane divider positions remembered across sessions
- **Centralized Project Service**: `ProjectService` manages current root, file path, and dirty state
- **Centralized Dialog Handling**: `DialogService` unifies error, confirmation, about & preferences dialogs
- **Background Task Overlay**: `BusyService` provides non-blocking async open/save with visual overlay (open/save now wrapped; further IO to follow)
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across macOS, Windows, and Linux

### âœ… Enhanced User Experience

- **Focus Restoration**: Maintains node selection after edit operations
- **Busy Overlay**: Prevents interaction during long-running IO tasks
- **Seamless Dialogs**: JavaFX dialogs with proper modal behavior (legacy About / Preferences now routed through DialogService)
- **Professional Styling**: High contrast design with modern appearance
- **Responsive Layout**: Declarative property bindings for menu enablement (selection, clipboard, undo/redo, save state)

### âœ… Data Management & Editing

- **Complete Milestone System**: Progress tracking with visual indicators
- **Work Package Management**: Feature assignment and organization (undoable)
- **Work Package Commands**: Add / Delete / Rename operations fully undoable
- **XML Project Files**: Reliable save/load with validation
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
- **Reserved Initials Band**: Stable feature box layout regardless of owner text
- **Snapshot-Based Editing**: Generalized EditNodeCommand captures name, prefix, owner initials, milestone statuses, and work package assignment for robust undo/redo

### âœ… Undo / Redo Foundation

- **Command Stack**: Reversible operations (Add Child, Delete Node, Paste Node, Generalized Edit, Work Package CRUD)
- **Rich Snapshots**: Multi-field snapshots (name/prefix/owner/milestones/work package)
- **Live Status Binding**: Status bar labels auto-bind to next undo/redo descriptions
- **Extensible Pattern**: Ready for future structural operations (drag/drop, bulk edits, preference changes)

### âœ… New & Recently Added (Aug 2025)

- **Property Binding Migration**: Menus & actions now declaratively bound (Undo/Redo, Save, clipboard, selection). Remaining: some panel buttons.
- **Dialog Centralization**: About & Preferences now served by `DialogService` (legacy methods removed/redirected).
- **Background IO Foundation**: `BusyService` + async Task wrapping of open/save to prevent UI stalls.
- **Work Package Command Tests**: Added regression coverage for add/rename/delete + undo/redo.
- **Project Service Tests**: Validates property transitions (hasProject / hasPath) and dirty clearing.
- **Busy Service Tests**: Verifies async callbacks (success & failure) on FX thread.

## Building and Running

FDD Tools uses a clean, best-practices approach for deployment:

### Building the Application

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This creates a self-contained "fat JAR" at `target/FDDTools-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` that includes:

- All JavaFX dependencies
- All required libraries
- Proper macOS Desktop API integration
- Application icon and resources

### Running the Application

#### Direct execution

```bash
java -jar target/FDDTools-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### macOS Integration

The application properly integrates with macOS using the Desktop API:

- (In progress) Ensure application name shows as "FDD Tools" in system menu (currently may display "java"; pending bundle metadata refinement)
- **System Menu Bar**: Application menus appear in the macOS system menu bar at the top of the screen (not in the window)
- **Custom Dock Icon**: Displays the FDD Tools icon in the dock (not the generic Java icon)
- Handles macOS About, Preferences, and Quit menu items
- Follows macOS UI guidelines

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses `MenuBar.setUseSystemMenuBar(true)` for proper menu integration
- Multiple icon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128) for optimal dock display
- AWT Taskbar API for reliable dock icon setting
- Early property configuration for consistent macOS behavior

### Development

For development, you can run directly through Maven:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

### Architecture

- **Fat JAR**: Single executable JAR containing all dependencies
- **Desktop API**: Native macOS integration without external scripts
- **JavaFX 21**: Modern UI framework with high-DPI support
- **Maven**: Standard build system following best practices

No shell scripts, no complex bundling - just a clean, professional executable JAR.
