# FDD Tools Development Roadmap

## Current Status (Aug 10 2025): Strategic Pivot â€“ Foundational Hardening Before New Feature Streams

The roadmap has been rebalanced to prioritize architectural, quality, testability, performance, and maintainability foundations ("platform hardening") BEFORE large feature additions (print/export, collaboration, advanced UX tooling). Functional expansion now intentionally trails core robustness work to reduce future rework cost and risk.

### âœ… Recently Completed Highlights (Aug 2025 Update)

| Area | Completed Items (Aug 2025) |
|------|----------------------------|
| JavaFX Foundation | FDDApplicationFX, FDDMainWindowFX, toolbar + menu system, ProjectService & DialogService, BusyService overlay + async open/save |
| Canvas & Rendering | FDDCanvasFX (zoom/pan), FDDGraphicFX, CenteredTextDrawerFX, progress overlay contrast logic |
| Tree & Actions | FDDTreeViewFX (auto-expand, selection styling), action panel, orange accent theme, menu enablement via property bindings, drag & drop reparent + ordered reorder (before/after/into) via extracted FDDTreeDragAndDropController, insertion indicators, snapshot drag image, invalid-drop tooltips, keyboard structural shortcuts (Alt+Up/Down/Left/Right) |
| Theming | Orange accent unification, selection + context menu color convergence, CSS specificity & warning clean-up |
| Dialog UX | About & Preferences routed through DialogService, success alerts trimmed, reusable centering helper |
| Edit Dialog Decomposition | FDDElementDialogFX phases 1â€“3 complete: milestone alignment/update helper, work package helper, generic info panel builder, feature panel builder |
| Persistence UX | RecentFilesService (MRU menu), LayoutPreferencesService (split divider persistence / deferred listener) |
| Internationalization | Multi-language resource bundles retained and loading verified |
| Undo/Redo | CommandExecutionService + generalized EditNodeCommand (milestones + work package) + Work Package CRUD commands with tests |
| Testing | Added ProjectService & BusyService tests (state transitions + async callbacks) |
| Logging & Diagnostics | Nested MDC scope handling, AUDIT & PERF dedicated rolling appenders, Span timing API (durationMs + metrics), audit events (project lifecycle, command execute/undo/redo, clipboard, image export), performance spans (canvas redraw, fitToWindow, export), expanded test suite (logging context, command stack trimming, persistence round-trip, progress milestone roll-up, failure overlay) |
| Async IO | Open / Save now non-blocking with BusyService overlay; image export now fully asynchronous with progress + cancel support |
| Preferences & Session | Expanded persistence: last project path, autoâ€‘load last project toggle, last zoom level persistence + restore toggle |
| Platform Purity | Replaced java.awt.Rectangle with WindowBounds record; macOS integration & dock icon encapsulated in MacOSIntegrationService; legacy MacOSHandlerFX deprecated (stub); AWT usage isolated to ImageExportService (export only) |
| Event Bus & Validation | Introduced ModelEventBus (node/tree/project events), dialog OK strategy (FeatureApplyStrategy), field validation (name/owner/prefix), debounced UI refresh |
| UI Load Path Refactor | Consolidated duplicate new/open/recent project UI assembly into single rebuild helper (prevents divergence + past canvas/tree disappearance) |
| Save Workflow Hardening | Standard Save vs Save As semantics (silent save to existing path, dialog only for first save or Save As); dirty state + MRU updates fixed |
| Filename Normalization | Removed double .fddi extension issue via sanitized default + extension enforcement helper |
| Tree Rename Refresh | Immediate tree label update after node edit (refresh + reselect) |
| Busy Overlay UX | Added delayed (180ms) overlay reveal to eliminate flicker for fast tasks |

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Focus (Short-Term Foundational Objectives)

Primary objective: Raise internal quality bar (architecture, state management, test harness) to make subsequent functional work cheaper & safer.

Incomplete (active / upcoming):

- [x] Externalize remaining hard-coded UI strings to ResourceBundle; audit localization completeness (runtime language switch + dynamic relabel registry in place)
- [ ] Optional: Eliminate residual AWT usage (image encoding & reflective Taskbar icon) for fully pure JavaFX distribution (currently isolated & acceptable)
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics capture script (load large synthetic project, measure render & refresh)
- [x] Logging extension (runtime audit/perf toggle via Preferences + system property override; JSON structured output deferred) â€“ COMPLETE
- [ ] Theme system expansion (semantic color mapping & full component coverage) â€“ High Contrast theme & centralized ThemeService added (PARTIAL)
  - Semantic base stylesheet added (semantic-theme.css) and integrated; initial canvas components (scroll pane, action bar, shortcut hint) migrated to semantic classes. Remaining: extend semantic classes across remaining canvas UI, tree, dialogs, overlays; refactor fdd-canvas.css; add automated theme swap smoke test.
- [x] Live language relabel infrastructure (listeners to re-apply keys on UI_LANGUAGE_CHANGED via I18nRegistry)
- [x] macOS app metadata alignment (name, menu bar title, bundle identifier) â€“ added packaging script (`scripts/package-macos.sh`) + overridable system properties
- [x] Fix intermittent feature label horizontal mis-centering (zoom rounding) (resolved via half-pixel snap in CenteredTextDrawerFX)

Completed (chronological):

- [x] Architectural decomposition (initial): ProjectService + DialogService extracted; command execution centralized
- [x] Convert imperative enable/disable logic to JavaFX property bindings (menus complete; remaining: some action panel buttons)
- [x] Introduce observable model events (lightweight event bus) decoupling UI refresh from direct calls
- [x] Central Error / Dialog utility (error, confirmation, about, preferences unified)
- [x] Background Task wrapper for IO (open/save complete â€“ extend to import/export later)
- [x] Undo/Redo foundation (command interface, stack, reversible add/delete/paste/edit with milestone & work package snapshots)
- [x] Preferences persistence (initial PreferencesService: window bounds, MRU size placeholder, language, theme placeholder)
- [x] Remove legacy Swing / AWT UI dependencies (frames, dialogs, Rectangle) â€“ COMPLETE (WindowBounds, service encapsulations)
- [x] Unit test harness bootstrap (RecentFilesService, LayoutPreferencesService, PreferencesService, command tests, work package, project service, busy service)
- [x] Additional coverage: nested MDC restoration, persistence round-trip (schema-valid), progress/milestone hierarchy sanity, command stack trimming bounds, failure overlay behavior)
- [x] Structured logging migration (java.util.logging -> SLF4J + Logback, MDC for commands/async/project/select) â€“ COMPLETE
- [x] Logging enhancements (audit + performance appenders, span timing API, contextual audit events) â€“ COMPLETE
- [x] Universal dialog centering helper (rollout ongoing; majority migrated)

Secondary (begin only after above green):

- [x] Tree drag & drop (reparent + ordered reorder with validation, insertion indicators, tooltips) â€“ COMPLETE
- [ ] Custom TreeCell (icons + progress pill) built on new binding system
- [ ] Event-driven UI relabel test coverage (simulate UI_LANGUAGE_CHANGED -> verify menu text update)
- [ ] MRU resilience test (simulate abnormal termination) & pruning of missing entries only

### Parity Gap Snapshot (Selected)

Concise view of the highest-impact remaining differences identified in the Swingâ†’JavaFX Functionality Mapping. (Mapping file remains the authoritative detailed matrix.)

| Area | Swing Capability | JavaFX Current State | Gap Action |
|------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Tree Interaction | Drag & Drop reorder/reparent | Implemented (reparent + ordered before/after + into, tooltips, auto-expand) | Future: per-node progress pill & advanced multi-select drag |
| Tree Visuals | Icons + (potential) progress indicators | Text-only cells | Custom TreeCell (icon + optional progress pill) |
| Tree Feedback | Inline progress per node | Absent | Integrate after custom cell baseline established |
| Preferences | Window bounds, last project path, zoom persistence (with restore toggle), auto-load last project | Core persistence present; theme & MRU size not yet exposed | Implement remaining preference fields (language/theme selector UI, MRU size), add validation & corruption recovery tests |
| Printing | Print / PDF manager | Placeholder | Implement PrinterJob pipeline + preview |
| Export Formats | PDF / (future SVG) | PNG/JPG only | Add PDF & SVG generation modules |
| Undo/Redo | N/A (desired enhancement) | Foundation implemented (add/delete/paste/edit + work package CRUD + milestone & membership snapshots) | Extend to drag/drop, preferences, panel edits |
| Action Enablement | Some dynamic binding | Manual toggles | Introduce BooleanProperty bindings |
| Model Structure | Swing TreeNode coupling | Pure JavaFX domain tree (FDDTreeNode) | âœ… Complete |
| Notifications | Basic blocking dialogs | Some alerts removed | Non-blocking toast/notification center |

Resolved former gap: Recent Files (MRU) now implemented via RecentFilesService.

### Structural / Medium-Term Targets (Post-Foundation Wave)

- [x] Abstract model away from javax.swing.tree.TreeNode (pure domain tree + adapter) âœ…
- [ ] (If not completed in Immediate Focus) Migrate / formally classify remaining Swing panels (AspectInfoPanel, WorkPackagePanel)
- [ ] Production-grade printing (PrinterJob pipeline + preview)
- [ ] Automated layout & rendering snapshot regression harness
- [ ] Theme variant: optional dark mode & accessible contrast mode
- [ ] Custom TreeCell with icon + optional progress pill / color band
- [ ] Preferences persistence layer (language, theme, recent files cap, future options)

### Longer-Term Evolution (Begins After Foundation & Medium Structural Tasks)

- [ ] Extended undo/redo coverage (drag/drop, preferences, batch ops, work package table edits)
- [ ] Advanced export: PDF / SVG / multi-resolution asset set
- [ ] Performance profiling for very large projects (> 2k features) & incremental redraw pipeline
- [ ] Collaboration groundwork (storage abstraction, sync hooks)
- [ ] Plugin or extension injection points
