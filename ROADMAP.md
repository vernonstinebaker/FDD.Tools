# FDD Tools Development Roadmap

## Current Status (Aug 8 2025): Core JavaFX Foundation Achieved â€“ Polishing, Consistency & Platform Refinement Underway

### âœ… Recently Completed Highlights

| Area | Completed Items (Aug 2025) |
|------|----------------------------|
| JavaFX Foundation | FDDApplicationFX, FDDMainWindowFX, DialogBridgeFX (Stage support), toolbar + menu system |
| Canvas & Rendering | FDDCanvasFX (zoom/pan), FDDGraphicFX, CenteredTextDrawerFX, progress overlay contrast logic |
| Tree & Actions | FDDTreeViewFX (auto-expand, selection styling), action panel, high-contrast toggle removal, orange accent theme |
| Theming | Orange accent unification, selection + context menu color convergence, CSS specificity & warning clean-up |
| Dialog UX | Removal of redundant success alerts, reusable centering helper (two-pass), applied to core Alerts; groundwork for universal centering |
| Persistence UX | RecentFilesService (MRU menu), LayoutPreferencesService (split divider persistence / deferred listener) |
| Internationalization | Multi-language resource bundles retained and loading verified |
| Cleanup | Legacy OSXAdapter removed, reduced SwingUtilities usage, deprecated DeepCopy eliminated (ObjectCloner) |
| Consistency | Reserved initials band standardizes feature box dimensions |

Additional polishing not in original roadmap: orange accent adoption, MRU + layout persistence, dialog centering infrastructure.

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus (Short-Term Objectives)

- [ ] Universal dialog centering (apply helper to About, Element, Paste error, Preferences, any residual Alerts)
- [ ] Fix intermittent feature label horizontal mis-centering (refine width calculation / rounding under zoom)
- [ ] Resolve macOS menu bar app name showing "java" (investigate early name set / bundle metadata / jpackage)
- [ ] Replace remaining JFileChooser references with JavaFX FileChooser
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate error dialog logic into single utility
- [ ] Validate MRU persistence across abnormal termination / reopen cycles
- [ ] Introduce undo/redo command stack scaffold (no-op commands to capture intent)
- [ ] Implement Tree drag & drop (node reorder / reparent with type validation & progress recalculation)

### Parity Gap Snapshot (Selected)

Concise view of the highest-impact remaining differences identified in the Swingâ†’JavaFX Functionality Mapping. (Mapping file remains the authoritative detailed matrix.)

| Area | Swing Capability | JavaFX Current State | Gap Action |
|------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Tree Interaction | Drag & Drop reorder/reparent | Not implemented | Add DnD handlers (start/over/drop) with validation + progress refresh |
| Tree Visuals | Icons + (potential) progress indicators | Text-only cells | Custom TreeCell (icon + optional progress pill) |
| Tree Feedback | Inline progress per node | Absent | Integrate after custom cell baseline established |
| Preferences | Persistent settings | UI only (no persistence) | Implement properties storage (language, theme, MRU size) |
| Printing | Print / PDF manager | Placeholder | Implement PrinterJob pipeline + preview |
| Export Formats | PDF / (future SVG) | PNG/JPG only | Add PDF & SVG generation modules |
| Undo/Redo | N/A (desired enhancement) | Missing | Command stack scaffold + reversible ops |
| Action Enablement | Some dynamic binding | Manual toggles | Introduce BooleanProperty bindings |
| Model Structure | Swing TreeNode coupling | Still coupled | Domain tree abstraction + adapter layer |
| Notifications | Basic blocking dialogs | Some alerts removed | Non-blocking toast/notification center |

Resolved former gap: Recent Files (MRU) now implemented via RecentFilesService.

### Structural / Medium-Term Targets

- [ ] Abstract model away from javax.swing.tree.TreeNode (pure domain tree + adapter)
- [ ] Introduce lightweight event bus / observer decoupling for UI/model
- [ ] Migrate or formally classify remaining Swing panels (AspectInfoPanel, WorkPackagePanel)
- [ ] Production-grade printing (PrinterJob pipeline + preview)
- [ ] Automated layout & rendering snapshot regression harness
- [ ] Theme variant: optional dark mode & accessible contrast mode
- [ ] Custom TreeCell with icon + optional progress pill / color band
- [ ] Preferences persistence layer (language, theme, recent files cap, future options)

### Longer-Term Evolution

- [ ] Undo/redo fully functional (structural + property edits)
- [ ] Advanced export: PDF / SVG / multi-resolution asset set
- [ ] Performance profiling for very large projects (> 2k features) & incremental redraw pipeline
- [ ] Collaboration groundwork (storage abstraction, sync hooks)
- [ ] Plugin or extension injection points
