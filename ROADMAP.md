#### 5.2 FDDGraphic Migration

- [ ] Create FDDGraphicFX component
- [ ] Implement node rendering (rectangles, circles, text)
- [ ] Add connection line drawing
- [ ] Support zoom and pan functionality

### ðŸ”® Phase 6: Main Frame (Future)

**Timeline**: After Phase 5 completion

#### 6.1 Main Frame Migration

- [ ] Create FDDFrameFX as primary window
- [ ] Migrate menu system to JavaFX MenuBar
- [ ] Implement toolbar with JavaFX ToolBar

- [ ] Remove Swing dependencies
- [ ] Final cleanup and optimization

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large projects
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize tree view rendering for large hierarchies

### User Experience Enhancements

- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- [ ] Implement undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Add export to PDF/PNG for diagrams
- [ ] Implement project templates

### Code Quality

- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for JavaFX components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for save/load operations
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Document public APIs

## Bug Fixes & Maintenance

### High Priority

- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Verify Java 21 compatibility across all platforms
- [ ] Test with large project files (>1000 features)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add logging framework for debugging
- [ ] Implement auto-save functionality
- [ ] Add project backup/restore features

## Release Planning

### Next Release (v1.1.0)

- **Focus**: Complete Phase 3 (Custom Components)
- **Target**: JavaFX Canvas and TreeView migration
- **Timeline**: Next development session

### Future Release (v2.0.0)

- **Focus**: Complete JavaFX migration
- **Target**: Full JavaFX application with no Swing dependencies
- **Timeline**: After all phases complete

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Follow JavaFX best practices and conventions
- Use CSS for styling instead of hard-coded values
- Implement proper MVVM pattern where appropriate
- Add comprehensive JavaDoc for public APIs

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new JavaFX components
- Integration tests for save/load operations
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Cross-platform testing on all supported OS

### Documentation Updates

- Update user manual for JavaFX interface changes
- Create migration guide for existing users
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Update API documentation
