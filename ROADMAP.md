# FDD Tools Development Roadmap

## Current Status (Aug 9 2025): Strategic Pivot â€“ Foundational Hardening Before New Feature Streams

The roadmap has been rebalanced to prioritize architectural, quality, testability, performance, and maintainability foundations ("platform hardening") BEFORE large feature additions (print/export, collaboration, advanced UX tooling). Functional expansion now intentionally trails core robustness work to reduce future rework cost and risk.

### âœ… Recently Completed Highlights

| Area | Completed Items (Aug 2025) |
|------|----------------------------|
| JavaFX Foundation | FDDApplicationFX, FDDMainWindowFX, DialogBridgeFX (Stage support), toolbar + menu system |
| Canvas & Rendering | FDDCanvasFX (zoom/pan), FDDGraphicFX, CenteredTextDrawerFX, progress overlay contrast logic |
| Tree & Actions | FDDTreeViewFX (auto-expand, selection styling), action panel, high-contrast toggle removal, orange accent theme |
| Theming | Orange accent unification, selection + context menu color convergence, CSS specificity & warning clean-up |
| Dialog UX | Removal of redundant success alerts, reusable centering helper (two-pass), applied to core Alerts; groundwork for universal centering |
| Persistence UX | RecentFilesService (MRU menu), LayoutPreferencesService (split divider persistence / deferred listener) |
| Internationalization | Multi-language resource bundles retained and loading verified |
| Cleanup | Legacy OSXAdapter removed, reduced SwingUtilities usage, deprecated DeepCopy eliminated (ObjectCloner) |
| Consistency | Reserved initials band standardizes feature box dimensions |

Additional polishing not in original roadmap: orange accent adoption, MRU + layout persistence, dialog centering infrastructure.

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Focus (Short-Term Foundational Objectives)

Primary objective: Raise internal quality bar (architecture, state management, test harness) to make subsequent functional work cheaper & safer.

- [ ] Architectural decomposition of `FDDMainWindowFX` (extract: ProjectService, PersistenceService, DialogService, ActionController)
- [ ] Convert imperative enable/disable logic to JavaFX property bindings (dirty, selection, clipboard, canSave)
- [ ] Introduce observable model events (lightweight event bus or listener interfaces) decoupling UI refresh from direct calls
- [ ] Central Error / Dialog utility (error, confirm, info, about, progress) replacing scattered Alert creation
- [ ] Background Task wrapper for IO (open/save) + busy overlay / disable interactions
- [x] Undo/Redo foundation (command interface, stack, reversible add/delete/paste/edit with milestone & work package snapshots)
- [ ] Preferences persistence (language, theme/dark-mode placeholder, MRU size, layout dividers) via Properties / JSON
- [ ] Externalize remaining hard-coded UI strings to ResourceBundle; audit localization completeness
- [ ] Replace remaining Swing / AWT leftovers (AWT Font, any JFileChooser references) â€“ pure JavaFX
- [ ] Unit test harness bootstrap (JUnit + TestFX/Monocle strategy doc) â€“ add initial tests for RecentFilesService & LayoutPreferencesService
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics capture script (load large synthetic project, measure render & refresh)
- [ ] Consistent logging strategy (levels: INFO ops, FINE diagnostic; remove System.out debug)
- [ ] macOS app metadata alignment (name, menu bar title, bundle identifier) pre-jpackage script definition
- [ ] Universal dialog centering finalization (apply helper everywhere)
- [ ] Fix intermittent feature label horizontal mis-centering (zoom rounding)

Secondary (begin only after above green):

- [ ] Tree drag & drop (reparent + reorder with validation & progress recalculation hooks)
- [ ] Custom TreeCell (icons + progress pill) built on new binding system
- [ ] MRU resilience test (simulate abnormal termination) & pruning of missing entries only

### Parity Gap Snapshot (Selected)

Concise view of the highest-impact remaining differences identified in the Swingâ†’JavaFX Functionality Mapping. (Mapping file remains the authoritative detailed matrix.)

| Area | Swing Capability | JavaFX Current State | Gap Action |
|------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Tree Interaction | Drag & Drop reorder/reparent | Not implemented | Add DnD handlers (start/over/drop) with validation + progress refresh |
| Tree Visuals | Icons + (potential) progress indicators | Text-only cells | Custom TreeCell (icon + optional progress pill) |
| Tree Feedback | Inline progress per node | Absent | Integrate after custom cell baseline established |
| Preferences | Persistent settings | UI only (no persistence) | Implement properties storage (language, theme, MRU size) |
| Printing | Print / PDF manager | Placeholder | Implement PrinterJob pipeline + preview |
| Export Formats | PDF / (future SVG) | PNG/JPG only | Add PDF & SVG generation modules |
| Undo/Redo | N/A (desired enhancement) | Foundation implemented (add/delete/paste/edit incl. milestones & work package) | Extend to drag/drop, preferences, panel edits |
| Action Enablement | Some dynamic binding | Manual toggles | Introduce BooleanProperty bindings |
| Model Structure | Swing TreeNode coupling | Pure JavaFX domain tree (FDDTreeNode) | âœ… Complete |
| Notifications | Basic blocking dialogs | Some alerts removed | Non-blocking toast/notification center |

Resolved former gap: Recent Files (MRU) now implemented via RecentFilesService.

### Structural / Medium-Term Targets (Post-Foundation Wave)

- [x] Abstract model away from javax.swing.tree.TreeNode (pure domain tree + adapter) âœ…
- [ ] (If not completed in Immediate Focus) Migrate / formally classify remaining Swing panels (AspectInfoPanel, WorkPackagePanel)
- [ ] Production-grade printing (PrinterJob pipeline + preview)
- [ ] Automated layout & rendering snapshot regression harness
- [ ] Theme variant: optional dark mode & accessible contrast mode
- [ ] Custom TreeCell with icon + optional progress pill / color band
- [ ] Preferences persistence layer (language, theme, recent files cap, future options)

### Longer-Term Evolution (Begins After Foundation & Medium Structural Tasks)

- [ ] Extended undo/redo coverage (drag/drop, preferences, batch ops, work package table edits)
- [ ] Advanced export: PDF / SVG / multi-resolution asset set
- [ ] Performance profiling for very large projects (> 2k features) & incremental redraw pipeline
- [ ] Collaboration groundwork (storage abstraction, sync hooks)
- [ ] Plugin or extension injection points
